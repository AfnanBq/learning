## Introduction
Online shopping has become one of the modern business aspects, so get knowing your customers' desires would help you to improve your methods to encourage them to purchase. In this project, I implemented a machine learning project that predicts if the customer intends to buy or not according to the customer's behaviors. The project is implemented by using a nearest-neighbor classifier and measuring the model performance through sensitivity and specificity values.
